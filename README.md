PHP 7
-----

The Pop PHP Framework has been fully tested for and works with PHP 7. However, as of July 1, 2016, due to
instability or deprecation of a few PHP extensions, the following components will have some sub-components
that are either not available or will not function properly in a PHP 7 environment:

#### pop-archive

- Due to the unavailability of the **rar** extension, the Rar class adapter will not function properly in PHP 7.

#### pop-cache

- Due to the current instability of the **apc/apcu/apc_bc** extenstions, the APC class adapter will not function properly in PHP 7.
- Due to the unavailability of the **memcache** extension, the Memcached class adapter will not function properly in PHP 7.

#### pop-geo

- Due to the unavailability of the **geoip** extension, the pop-geo component will not fully function in PHP 7.

INSTALL
-------
There are multiple ways you can get Pop PHP Framework into your project.

You can add it to an existing project:

```console
$ composer require popphp/popphp-framework
```

You can add it your project's `composer.json` file:

    "require": {
        "popphp/popphp-framework": "2.1.*"
    }

You can create a new project and install it into that project:

```console
$ composer create-project popphp/popphp-framework project-folder
```

Or, you can clone this repository and install it directly:

```console
$ composer install
```
